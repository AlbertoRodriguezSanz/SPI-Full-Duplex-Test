### SPI Slave device

This device's firmware is programmed without the abstraction given by the use of MCC, in a single file, which contains all of the required functions for initialization and operation. 

## Device configuration

- Configuration bits (CONFIG1-5H/L registers)
  - Oscillator source at power-up: High frequency internall oscillator with no clock division applied
  - Master Clear and Low Voltage Programming: MCLR and LVP are enabled, making the MCLR pin work for as a master clear for programming.
  - Brown-out Reset: Disabled, device will not reset when voltage drops under a certain threshold.
  - Watchdog Timer: Disabled, the Windowed Watchdog Timer will not be enabled for this test, to check for timing inaccuracies while executing instructions.
- Clock Manager (OSCCON1-3, OSCEN, OSCFRQ and OSCTUNE registers)
  - hola  
- Pin Manager:
  -
